Phase 1 
Github repository: https://github.com/tangteresa/INFO2950-Project 

Idea 1: What combination of factors results in the greatest post-undergrad salary for CS majors (not including grad school)?

Factors: 
School’s undergraduate computer science program prestige (as ranked by US News) 
Average professor rating from ratemyprofessors.com (better professors might mean better students, which would affect their pay)
Note: There may be biases in these ratings -- are people who are unhappy with professors more likely to rate? 
Student teacher ratio (from US News or College Simply)
Class size (from US News) 
Location 
Finding the metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area that the college is in (based on definitions by the Bureau of Labor) and then taking the salary of computer-related jobs in that geographic region for comparison 
We organize by metropolitan area because it is more representative of the income distribution of the city and its surroundings (a metropolitan area includes places that commute into the city) -- we did not organize by state or region (Midwest, Northeast, etc.) because those are too general and not representative of the urban/rural and distributions of incomes within the state 
School population (larger schools might have more alumni access, but also less one on one interaction, leading to less learning…)

Sampling Ideas: 
Favorite idea: analyze all 481 schools listed in the best CS schools from US News
Randomly select 20 schools per state (50 states * top 20 schools = 1000 schools) 
Per state: 1st ranked, last ranked, middle ranked, & the rest of the 17 are randomly generated

Possible Datasets:
Salary post-graduation: https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-majors/computer-science 
Computer Science Program Ranking (determined via survey): https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/computer-science-overall 
Teacher-to-student ratio: https://oedb.org/rankings/student-faculty-ratio/ (also available on US News or College Simply)
Average Professor Rating: https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ 
Location, Student Population: https://www.collegesimply.com/ 
Bureau of Labor Statistics: dataset of salary by occupation (we would have to filter for CS-related occupations) for every metropolitan area: https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151251.htm 
Mapping of metropolitan areas to counties (and then counties get mapped to school):  https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/msa_def.htm#S 



Idea 2: What proportion of Wikipedia contributors are credible/experienced? 
Dataset: Wikipedia 
Article revision history (to show us who has contributed to the article)
Example: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moorestown,_New_Jersey&action=history 
User talk page (shows where bots flag users for community violations or other users critique/question that person’s edits) 
Example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Chris_the_speller 
User contribution page (lists articles this user has contributed to) 
Example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Chris_the_speller 
Credibility will be determined by: 
Whether someone else undid this contributor’s revision
How many contributions this person has made 
Whether this person has been flagged for community violations



Idea 3: What is the association between these factors below and education level per state?

Factors: 
Political affiliation 
Religion 
Population (More ppl →  more taxes →  more funding) 
Educational facilities (i.e. after school activities)
Libraries 
Internet Access 
Funding for education 
% students that are home-schooled

Sample: 
50 sample points, one for each state

Possible Datasets:
Party Affiliation: https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/party-affiliation/by/state/ 
Religion: https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/ 
Population: https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2019/national-state-estimates.html 
Libraries per state: https://librarytechnology.org/libraries/uspublic/
Per-pupil spending (funding): https://www.edweek.org/ew/collections/quality-counts-2019-state-finance/map-per-pupil-spending-state-by-state.html 
Education level per state: https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17829 
Internet Access: https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19_702.12.asp 
Homeschooling:
https://rs.io/where-is-homeschooling-most-popular-states-by-the-numbers/ (not all states listed)
https://responsiblehomeschooling.org/research/summaries/homeschooling-numbers/ (doesn’t give total # of students per state)
https://a2zhomeschooling.com/thoughts_opinions_home_school/numbers_homeschooled_students/ (2017-2018, gives total # of students so we can calculate % homeschooling)

Problem: States may not be a meaningful distinction (i.e. it might be more meaningful to go by county), but we haven’t found many datasets for county-level analysis

Questions for Reviewers: 
For idea 1, is it alright if we don’t take into account where students move to after graduation when we analyze school location? Realistically, if students tend to move to places like California then their salaries will be higher, regardless of where their college was located, but not every school publicizes this information.
